Good evening All. I thank God for the lives of everyone here.
Please if you are a prayer warrior or prayer champion here, we need to gather at the back of Gen at delta Park to pray for Nigeria. This time specifically for Niger Delta. Because the revelations coming out from the NDDC saga is about to wake up abacha from the grave. We are on a sweet cruise. Just floating.

7/21/20, 7:29 AM - +234 706 481 3929: *The World Needs More Faithful Men*  

Article by Scott Hubbard
Editor, desiringGod.org

Hidden among the nine shining fruit of the Spirit is a virtue some men might find bland. Compared to other marks of Christlikeness, its grandeur may seem small; its glory, dim. The labor required to cultivate this grace can feel unequal to the rewards it offers. Many of us are tempted to forsake the pursuit of it in search of nobler successes or achievements.

And yet, if we lack this fruit of the Spirit, we lose every good thing given to us. Our youthful resolves give way to adult indifference, our marriages and ministries slowly wilt, and our best ambitions eventually fade with a sigh. This quality is certainly not the only mark of a godly man, but without it a man will not stay godly for long. In fact, he will not stay anything for long: not devoted to his family, not diligent in his work, not zealous in his Master’s business.

What is it? Not love, joy, or peace; not patience, kindness, or goodness; not gentleness or self-control — but faithfulness (Galatians 5:22–23).

*Words with Weight*
Like many of the Spirit’s fruits, faithfulness is not all that difficult to understand. Faithful men are reliable, dependable, trustworthy. They give their word to what matters, and then they live as if that word has weight.

We find faithfulness first in God himself. When we say “God is faithful” (1 Corinthians 1:9), we mean, in large part, that he always does what he says he will do: “He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it” (1 Thessalonians 5:24). No word that goes out from God’s mouth comes back to him empty or untrue (Isaiah 55:10–11). With a faithful God, what you hear is what you get.

A faithful man, in his own imperfect way, reflects this same trustworthiness. He does not “make plans according to the flesh, ready to say ‘Yes, yes’ and ‘No, no’ at the same time” (2 Corinthians 1:17). Rather, so far as it depends on him, he “swears to his own hurt and does not change” (Psalm 15:4).

“A faithful man is as valuable and yet as inconspicuous as a beating heart.”
*When this man says he’ll do something — whether as significant as loving a woman for life or as trivial as taking out the trash — others don’t need to wonder whether he actually will. He does not need constant oversight, regular reminders, or daily prodding to fulfill his responsibilities. Nor does he need to add extra assurances on top of his bare word in order to win trust; a simple “Yes” or “No” suffices (Matthew 5:37).*

So, faithfulness is not all that difficult to understand. Just to live.

In Search of Faithful Men
Ours is not the first age to struggle with faithfulness. Some three millennia ago, a wise man said, “Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love, but a faithful man who can find?” (Proverbs 20:6). Desiring a reputation for faithfulness without actually being faithful; expecting others’ trust without living in a trustworthy manner — these temptations are ancient as well as modern.

We need not wonder why. For one, true faithfulness grows slowly. This grace reveals itself not in a day or a week or a month, but over years — even over a whole lifetime. Almost any man can sprint for a hundred yards; only faithful men can run the slower, lifelong race of faith without giving up or getting distracted.

Faithfulness is also hard work. Many days come when faithful men would prefer a different course than the one in front of them — when they would rather take a break from killing their sin, pursuing their wives, disciplining their children, laboring at their job. But while other men say, “Not feeling like it,” and retreat to the couch, these men get on their knees, plead with God, and do the next thing.

Finally, faithfulness is often thankless. By its very nature, it goes largely unnoticed: rarely showy, ever steady, a faithful man is as valuable and yet as inconspicuous as a beating heart. That he can be taken for granted is, in a sense, his glory.

Yet despite the difficulties that attend true faithfulness, the world desperately needs such faithful men. Men whose word means something more than maybe. Men whose resolve does not crumble before monotony or hardship. Men who keep covenant in marriage for a lifetime. Men who do not flit from job to job, but who gladly plod on the same paths until their Lord directs them elsewhere. Men who burn to hear spoken over them those words that will echo through eternity: “Well done, good and faithful servant” (Matthew 25:21, 23).

*Land of Little*
Where does such faithfulness come from? How do men like us, faithless by nature, strive to “be found faithful” (1 Corinthians 4:2)? We can begin by remembering the place where faithfulness grows and the person whom faithfulness glorifies.

Consider first the place where faithfulness grows. No matter how faithful we are at this moment, more faithfulness will grow in the same place where the Spirit so often cultivates his fruit: in responsibilities and tasks that feel small, unimportant, ordinary. In other words, in little things.

“The faithfulness that so often goes unnoticed on earth will by no means be forgotten in heaven.”
Jesus gives us the principle, “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much” (Luke 16:10). Many men dream of much: of family legacies and lasting ministries, of great awakenings and large followings. Whether God glorifies his name through us in these ways is ultimately a matter of his providence and good pleasure. But one thing is certain on our end: fickleness in little will never produce faithfulness in much.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer once wrote, “It is the mark of a grown-up man, as compared with a callow youth, that he finds his center of gravity wherever he happens to be at the moment, and however much he longs for the object of his desire, it cannot prevent him from staying at his post and doing his duty” (Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Brief Life, 74).

Bonhoeffer’s “post” at the time of writing was a prison cell. Our post at the moment, though less confining, may still feel constricted: an entry-level job when we’d like to own a business, a house with roommates when we want to be married, a youth-pastor position when we’d prefer to be preaching. But here — in this post, in this place of “very little” — we learn to be faithful.

*Lord of Little*
We would be wrong, however, to treat the little in front of us merely as a waiting room for the much of our dreams. No act of faithfulness, no matter how unseen and seemingly insignificant, is simply a stepping stone. Each act is a new opportunity to glorify and commune with our Lord.

Jesus, our faithful Savior, has his eye on the small places, on the forgotten moments, on the little things. And in the face of every unwelcome duty, he would have us remember that “whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord” (Ephesians 6:8). When our eyes are lifted toward our Master, whatever good we do — whether much or little, great or small — will come back to us. The faithfulness that so often goes unnoticed on earth will by no means be forgotten in heaven.

*In every faithful word to your family, in every hour of Bible-study or sermon preparation, in every small but painful conversation that lies in the path of love, can you feel your Savior’s pleasure? Can you hear the first whispers of “Well done, good and faithful” (Matthew 25:21, 23)? Can you grasp the promise that every faithful work will be found in heaven’s ledgers? And can you see, as you set one unremarkable stone on top of another, what you are building by the grace of God?*

Our faithfulness here, even in little, is no little matter. In the unremarkable moments of life, God is shaping his fickle sons into the image of his Faithful One (Revelation 19:11). Every day, he forgives our lingering faithlessness, and every day conforms us to Christ’s faithfulness.

7/22/20, 7:57 AM - Kes Wog: Oh no! Who's this lady and Why suffer like this? Please where's she at the moment. No Bro don't say doctors have tried to no avail, Good doctors have not managed her yet and she may have been taken some things for granted. You may not have the correct history. What she has there is somewhat a cellulitis that she overlooked.
Please where's she? She must be admitted in a good hospital and for a good while and investigated, aggressive wound dressing, branded antibiotics and so on. This will cost some bucks... We all can support in that. Hope she's not diabetic? This should not get to amputation. She's too young for that. 
NO HERBAL PLEASE! I'm not against them but not at this stage. 
She will get over this but needs proper care. That's the only our body responds in Christ. Glory to God 
My submission.
7/22/20, 8:03 AM - Dotman: Thanks Dr Kez
7/22/20, 8:03 AM - Kes Wog: C'mon guys. I need information on this, where she is? what's happening at the moment. No time for more delays now. Why suffer body loss when it can be avoided. Finance may be the reason she hasn't got proper care
7/22/20, 8:03 AM - Dotman: Dr Kez do you mind if she calls you or should I send her your number so you call her?
7/22/20, 8:04 AM - Dotman: We have to first of all raise a support purse for her
7/22/20, 8:05 AM - Kes Wog: I don't mind at all. It's even good to know she strong enough to talk. We're winning then... Give her my contact please
7/22/20, 8:05 AM - Kes Wog: This can be ongoing
7/22/20, 8:06 AM - Dotman: OK I was thinking I give you hers so she doesn't call when you are busy

Anyways she's going to make inquiry alongside her siblings now on a good hospital over there to manage the condition based on my criteria for a good hospital. This is not a big deal. With proper care she'll be alright. 
So I wish we all take up responsibility in assisting her especially financially. She'll do well.

7/22/20, 8:58 PM - Kes Wog: Hello good evening brethren. Hope our day went well? Mine was busy but good still.
I just talked with our Sis again now and from the look of things she has to manage the condition on out patient basis (ie not on hospital admission because the hospital there... I'm not surprised) but the modalities are still acceptable. 
1. She'll go from home to a clinic where a nurse will do the dressing at least twice daily (costing about N500 per dressing  so about 5k will cover 5days dressing and that will go a long way) 
2. I desire she uses a branded broad spectrum antibiotics like Rocephin intravenously (doctors understand this) which is pretty expensive compare to the unbranded but the outcome will be better. She'll need about 5 days of this antibiotic and 2gram daily. Each gram cost 4k totally 40k. 
3. The other antibiotic gentamycin she'll need 160mg daily and this is affordable 
4. The 3rd antibiotic metronidazole I suggested she takes that orally since she can't go on admission and home administering will be cumbersome. This is also cheap 
5. The medication for pain is not left out which she'll take orally also. It's also very affordable.

Bye and bye she'll need about 50k to run the show. She's not really able financially from my talk with her and I don't think this is so much although I know it's impromptu. Well we can do the little we can go get her started.

Bro Dotun and Bro Progress can man the raise tonight so she starts at once. I sent 5k to her earlier today to assist with the findings and I still have her account details. Please let's get down to business.
I hope I could present this clearly? 

God Bless you all

*Why God’s Men Need Good Men*

Article by 
Marshall Segal

Friendship, especially among men, is something we lament when absent and yet often take for granted when we have it. Good brothers are hard to find, and surprisingly easy to squander. While we focus on the many battles before us, and behind us, and within us, we can forget the men we need beside us.

For a couple decades now, I have searched for men to follow Christ beside — friends who are closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24). Over and over again, God has given me brothers who know my strengths and weaknesses, my fears, failures, and victories; brothers who are warm with compassion but will confront me to protect me; men whose hearts belong to Jesus and who have been conquered by grace. For my marriage, my family, and my ministry to prevail, I cannot afford to lead, love, or fight alone as a man. My wife and I both know I need other men. And we know she needs other Sarahs, women who “do good and do not fear anything that is frightening” (1 Peter 3:6).

“If we enjoy deep and abiding friendship with other men in Christ, God has done it.”

If men do not have deep and abiding friendships with other men, we should make some serious efforts to find them — seeking out godly brothers, organizing time together, initiating with older and wiser men, discipling younger faithful men, bearing the significant costs of meaningful friendships. Good soldiers don’t stumble onto the battlefield. They prepare. They train. They count the cost. They set aside distractions. They lock arms.

*Uncommon Brothers*

King David, who lived much of his life in the trenches, knew the value of real brotherhood: “Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!” (Psalm 133:1).

Because so many of us have seen it printed on greeting cards and coffee mugs during peacetime, we may miss the depth and cost of such unity. David was hunted by his predecessor, betrayed by his son (who murdered his other son), abandoned by his inner circle, and opposed by the people he had served so well. When he says words like good and pleasant, he does so with a mouth that has tasted the bitterness of disunity, hostility, and estrangement.

As Christians, this unity will not look the same for every man in every friendship, or even for the same man over a lifetime of friendships, but it will be rooted in one man: our one Lord, one Savior, one Treasure, Jesus Christ. Uncommon brothers share a common allegiance, a common mission, a common first love, because they share him. Who are those men for you?

*Reinforcements from Heaven*

David knew unity among brothers is not normal. And he knew where uncommon brothers come from.

Behold, how good and pleasant it is
     when brothers dwell in unity!
It is like the precious oil on the head,
     running down on the beard,
on the beard of Aaron,
     running down on the collar of his robes!
It is like the dew of Hermon,
     which falls on the mountains of Zion!
For there the Lord has commanded the blessing, 
        life forevermore. (Psalm 133:1–3)

“The most effective way for men to find the friends we need is to spend serious time alone on our knees.”

More could be said, but as Derek Kidner notes, this kind of unity and brotherhood only comes from above — like oil down the head or dew from heaven. If we enjoy deep and abiding friendship with other men in Christ, God has done it. Think about that. If you have the kind of brothers David is describing, God mobilized that brotherhood — how you would meet, what would bind you together, the wars you would fight together, what would keep you from walking away. He poured the oil of his favor on you in friendship.

This means that if we want deeper, more serious friendships, we start by asking God. The most effective way for men to find the friends we need is to begin with serious time alone on our knees. We cannot force real friendship. This is not ultimately in our control. And in God’s wisdom, many good friendships will come and go, ebb and flow, and then ebb again. A few unusual friends may endure over decades.

So, if we find ourselves, like David, dwelling in unity with blood-bought brothers, what can we do to fight the battle well together?

*Two Are Better Than One*

George Whitefield (1714–1770) once preached on this kind of uncommon brotherhood from Ecclesiastes 4:9–12, which says,

Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him — a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

Whitefield said, “Woe be to him that is alone; for when he falleth, he hath not another to lift him up: When he is cold, he hath not a Friend to warm him; when he is assaulted, he hath not a Second to help him to withstand his Enemy.” He explained why two, in the eyes and plans of God, are truly better than one, and then taught us three ways uncommon brothers love each other in the trenches of life, marriage, family, and ministry: reprove, exhort, and defend.

*REPROVE*

Again, Ecclesiastes 4:10 says, “If they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!” One of the most precious (and severe) mercies of a brother is how he responds to our sins and failures. Many men fall into sin without another man strong enough, loving enough, or courageous enough to call him to repentance. Good men not only speak up when they see sin, but they love when others show them their own sin, however hard it may feel in the moment.

“We don’t just need male friends; we need male friends on fire for God.”

Every man can fall (1 Corinthians 10:12). You and I can fall. And if we live as if we cannot, we are far more likely to fall. And if we do fall, and we all inevitably fall in various ways, we need brothers who will confront us (2 Samuel 12:7–9), restore us (Galatians 6:1), and then walk with us back out onto the battlegrounds for holiness.

*EXHORT*

The preacher continues, “If two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?” (Ecclesiastes 4:11). This may make modern men squirm (or even laugh), but that’s only because we have known so little of war. We’ve never woken up to a fellow soldier who froze to death overnight. Men of God know they need the heat of one another’s love for God. We need to be spurred on by one another’s passion, hard work, sacrifice, courage, and ambition for Christ. We don’t just need male friends; we need male friends on fire for God.

What men in your life consistently stir you up to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24)? What men charge you to walk in a manner worthy of God (1 Thessalonians 2:12)? What men exhort you, even daily, to keep you from being deceived by sin (Hebrews 3:13)?

*ASSIST AND DEFEND*

Lastly, if we have uncommon brothers, we assist and defend one another. Ecclesiastes 4:12 says, “Though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him — a threefold cord is not quickly broken.” Men fall alone on the battlefield who would not have fallen had another man been there. Our enemy loves to isolate a man from his unit, where he is exposed, vulnerable, defenseless. Wise men, however, do not wander out alone against the spiritual forces of evil (Ephesians 6:12), and they will not let their brother fight alone.

When the apostle Peter wrote to the persecuted church, believers under siege spiritually and socially, he wrote, “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly” (1 Peter 4:8). This is how the war will be won. We prevail by loving one another earnestly — monitoring weaknesses and vulnerabilities, meeting needs, watching blind spots, correcting errors and confronting sins, instilling hope and defying darkness together. When the fires of trial swell, we are and love to be our brother’s keeper.

*Uncommon Blessing*

True brotherhood, life-or-death friendship in the trenches, comes from God above, through Christ, but it does not only come to us as a blessing. Deep and sincere brotherhood extends the blessing outward and in every direction. Notice, again, what David says,

[Unity among brothers] is like the dew of Hermon,
     which falls on the mountains of Zion!
For there the Lord has commanded the blessing,
     life forevermore. (Psalm 133:3)

One reason we pursue real, deep, enduring friendships as men is because of how that kind of brotherhood nourishes our marriages, families, churches, and communities. Wives and children are led and cared for with greater affection and conviction. Churches are served and strengthened with greater selflessness and wisdom. Crises are addressed with greater humility, courage, and compassion. Workplaces and communities are filled with greater light and hope.

Everyone benefits when Christian men faithfully give themselves to one another, when uncommon brothers love one another in uncommon ways.

Drain your blood spiritually? Oh my goodness! How? From where? We're not mates, Abeg. Isn't it funny to reason that way? What a way to think. What is he listening to? Hmmm... 

Brethren my counsel, DO NOT SPREAD THIS FEAR. NO. ITS A DISTRACTION. IF YOU HAVE SHARED IT ALREADY, DELETE IT. 

There will always be scammers,na so the world be,  but We trust God's spirit in us to be discerning of them always. You too do not be in a hurry to make decisions or greedy. Be smart. Be content. Always check with your inside first. No rush.. You'll make less mistakes.

7/26/20, 12:33 AM - +234 706 481 3929: *God Is Faithful to Forgive Your Sins*

*_If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness._* — 1 John 1:9

When our lives are under a great amount of stress, it is easy to fall back into the mindset that our acceptance with God is performance-based. The best of saints struggle with this problem. Do you experience the sense of guilt that you are never doing enough to please God? Is there a lingering fear that maybe God does not love or accept you?

*_Stressful times can lead to the resurrection of old addictions and struggles of the past._*

Most likely, those sentiments arise in connection with certain sins in our lives. Maybe it is that same sin you have struggled with for years without the deliverance you thought would be given by now. Maybe it is because you struggle with how little your devotion is to the Lord. Maybe the experience of constant failure has become overwhelming.

What may actually be happening to many believers in times of uncertainty is not stronger devotion to Christ but rather the resurrection of old addictions and struggles of the past. Stress and anxiety have a strange way of prompting us to reach for old idols. Those idols always have been and still are death to us, and yet we grab them for relief. Through it all we wonder, does the Lord still accept us?

*_In 1 John 1:9 God provides ongoing help for those who are already forgiven of all their sins._*

At times like this, it is good to meditate on the promise of 1 John 1:9. The Holy Spirit inspired these words to reassure believers who are confused and struggling over the continued presence of sin in their lives. Here, God gives his prescription for how we can respond in faith when we find ourselves doing the things we do not want to do, or neglecting to do the things he wants us to do (see Romans 7).

In this remarkable promise, God provides ongoing help for those who are already forgiven of all their sins. While we were still sinners, Jesus died for us, so that all of our sins are atoned for—past, present, and future. If this were not so, his words on the cross, “it is finished,” would mean nothing to us outside of Jesus breathing his last. Jesus finished the work of actually atoning for our sins.

Having received Christ by faith, the Scriptures make clear that we have been forgiven (χαρισάμενος) of all our trespasses (Col. 2:13). The aorist tense of the Greek verb “forgiven” is telling us this was a completed action. The force of this is to communicate that the objective work of Christ has secured the forgiveness of all your trespasses, now and forever. It was in this connection that Jesus assured the disciples that they were “already clean” based on his sacrificial work. 1 John 1:9 is a recognition of our ongoing need for help and reassurance of the work of Christ for us. Nevertheless, forgiveness is a definite outcome based on Jesus’ work on the cross.

*_We don’t need a priest, pastor, or any other mediator outside of Christ to confess our sins to God._*

“Confess your sins to me,” says the Lord. You don’t need a priest, pastor, or any other mediator outside of Christ to do this. Our heavenly Father is inviting us to be honest and open with him, with specificity, about the sins we have committed. When we sin, we experience a disruption in our fellowship with God through the defilement sin brings. Sin is alienating and disruptive to proper fellowship with Christ. As saints who still sin, we regularly have need to be restored in the knowledge that we are forgiven and cleansed before the Lord.

The Lord lifts us out of the guilt and defilement that we bring on ourselves. He assures us of his faithfulness to forgive and cleanse us once and for all, based on the sacrifice of Jesus for our sins. He renews these objective realities to our hearts when we draw near to him burdened over our sins, with our eyes fixed on our righteous advocate who has already made propitiation for them all (1 John 2:2).

*_The Lord is faithful and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness._*

What a relief it is to remember and be renewed in the joy of our salvation; assured of the forgiveness and cleansing that is ours in Christ. Through prayer, by his grace, the Lord renews us in his promises as we receive from him the washing of our consciences from sinful works (Heb. 9:14). In this way, our hearts are “reassured before him” (1 John 3:19).

In your struggles with sin, talk with your Lord. Your heavenly Father is gracious, merciful, and long-suffering. As the Heidelberg Catechism says,

For it is much more certain that God has heard my prayer than I feel in my heart that I desire such things from him. (Q &A 129)

Therefore, confess your sins to the Lord. He is faithful and just to forgive them and cleanse you from all unrighteousness, so as to reassure you of his steadfast love for you in Christ.

7/26/20, 2:47 PM - Progress tech: 26.7.2020

*IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE*


John 2:1-11

*POINTS TO NOTE*

1. There are strange instructions that give extraordinary results

2. Explanation and revelation are not the same. Your thoughts, your ideas can't build ministry. Isa 55:8

3. In intentional ministry, after strategies comes revelation.

4. True wisdom is not understood by explanation but by results. Luk 11:35

5. Any progressive ministry must have an element of madness.

6. The soul can dominate material world, but spirit superimposes the supernatural.

*WHAT DID GOD ASK YOU TO DO IN 2020?*

• The objective of every instruction is primarily to make you an instrument in achieving the desire of the instructor.

• The spiritual instructions you obey will determine the extent of your supernatural experience.

• If you don't have your own instruction you can't build your ministry.

*INTERACTIONS*

• How far have you ran with what God told you to do in 2020?

• Have you ever received a divine instruction that doesn't make logical sense? 

• Ever worked with an instruction from God that "doesn't make sense" and got a supernatural result/s? Share your experiences.

• What effect has the global pandemic had on your assignment..? Positive or negative or none.

7/26/20, 8:15 PM - +44 7721 937330: Good evening friends,  I want to talk about the debate we had a few days ago about people's engagement on the group. My view of this is similar to Joseph's and Harold's views. Indeed people have moved on. Not moved on in the sense that they don't care about former friends and brethren from WoG days but people are at a different stage in life right now with new responsibilities. Once people leave uni, you find out that when in school you had a lot of time but now in real life, not so much anymore. And yes, you never know whats going on in people's lives. I expect this group to grow quieter with time but I also expect that our engagement here will be more decisive and continuous like contributing money to help brothers or sisters in need like we did last week. I think that will continue and that is Christian service so its still a win for the church of Christ

*YOU CAN’T BUT STEP ON EACH OTHER’S TOES!*

One of the most widely promoted assumptions in the school of marriage is the phrase, “You cannot but step on each other’s toes”. To this I differ and I dare to say nothing can be more fallacious. The fact that an idea has become generally acceptable because of its frequent occurrences must not be taken as sufficient argument for its validity. Marriage as a subject has its own complexities and most the definitions employed to depict some of its components are divergent and debatable.

In my last post, captioned “The Myth of Hitch-Free Marriage”, I did say, I believe so much in the ideology that there is no impossibility under the sun, and humankind has proved this time and again. I concluded that piece with the famous words of Henry Ford, “Whether you think you CAN, or you think you CAN’T, you’re right”.  The crux of this piece is clear, Never Say Never! Some marriages are experiencing mutual and perpetual peace without stitch or hitch today. Rather than merely muse and take their claim with pinch of salt, it makes more sense reaching them and seeking their secrets.

Adejare Adeboye [E.A. Adeboye of RCCG] is one of the humblest human beings on earth. His marriage has been so amiable that he has over the years become a point of reference. But it never just happened, the couple made it so. Remember, it takes two to tangle and nothing can ever work except someone works it out.  Foluke was a teenager of 19, and Adejare was a budding youth of 25 when they got married. As expected, according to Adeboye, some people expected the marriage to be marred with hiccups.  

One thing that I still need to understand about humankind is why in the world should anyone expect, of all things, strike and strife from marriages?  There are too much of pretense and mischiefs in human race. People don’t seem to expect to see a happy marriage but they are excited to hear that a marriage is on the verge of collapse, why? Anyway, Adejare and his cherished wife entered their closet and sat eye-ball-eye-ball to chart a bright future for their marriage and future home.  I will reveal what they discussed later.



*YOU CAN’T BUT STEP ON EACH OTHER’S TOES! PART 2*

Today, as I conclude this discussion, I like to remove all traces of ambiguities. From different platforms, I have received many questions and responses. Some questioned the veracity of my standing point while others simply desire further clarity on the subject matter. Someone even warned me not to site the marriages of David Oyedepo and Enoch Adeboye as examples because he said I wouldn’t be too sure if such marriages are truly as hitch-free as they are claimed to be.  

Another colleague quipped that one can’t afford to use the information supplied by a fellow as the true position of what goes on in his or her marriage. What that means is that anyone who claims his marriage is stable or hitch-free is a blatant liar! To this I replied, nobody knows a person the way the person knows himself, therefore, the testimony of a married person about his or her marriage should not be termed untrue until one is able to supply stronger arguments to prove him or her wrong. 

Again, why is it easier to believe and get interested in negative stories about people’s marriages than to accept good reports about them? Truly, the fact that a marriage is said to be hitch-free is not the same as not facing challenges. In fact such marriages are the mostly attacked, just to soil their good reports. What makes a marriage hitch-free is the firm resolve of the couple to prevent all appearances of unpleasant situations from creating distraction or forming lacuna in their marriage.   

David Oyedepo told his wife from day one, “You cannot offend me because I have forgiven you long ahead”. Adejare Adeboye sat with his wife and they agreed, “Both of us MUST not be angry at the same time. If I am angry, you will be quiet with sufficient patience and vice versa. According to Adeboye, this resolution was nearly broken one day. But they remembered their agreement, and the matter ended there. No matter how long you have been married, your hitch-free marriage can still start today.

"Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. Song of Solomon 8:6"

Devotion: King Solomon, a man of wisdom, was moved by love to utter such wonderful words. This is true of Jesus Christ in the New Testament, who was sufficiently moved by love to die for the salvation of mankind. His love could not be hidden; therefore, the Father proved his love for Christ by raising Him from the grave. What a wonder!

When you die, what happens next? Don't worry, don't be concerned over your body because it's the first thing people will take care of. They will do what is required, of course, your name would have been changed to " *The Corpse* ".

They will
1 - Take you out of the comfort of your expensive home.
2 - Buy you new white clothes
3 - Wash your body
4 - Take you to your new place of stay (the grave, where equality of mankind is assured)
5 - Many will come to bid farewell at your funeral - in fact, many will cancel work for the sake of your burial, even though most of them didn't know you whilst you were alive.
6 - Your belongings will be gotten rid of:
  - Your cars
  - Your cheque books
  - Your bags
  - Your shoes
  - Your clothes
  - Your job: Someone else will take your position (Whether in the circular world or in the church)
   - Your wealth will go to inheritors or opportunists
   - Whereas you will remain to be questioned about every minor and major deed.

Mourners will congregate and there will be 3 types of mourners over you
* 1- The people who knew you only at face value will say 'poor man'
* 2- Your friends will grieve for hours or days but then return to laughter
* 3- The deep grief at your household will last for a week, two weeks, a month, 2-months or even a year; and thereafter they will add you to their memories. And so your story amidst the people ended
*while your story with the reality begins: "Eternity". Where have you prepared to spend it?* And that is the life after death

Indeed, the following things will leave you:-
* - Beauty
* - Wealth
* - Health
* - Children
* - Connections and influence 
* - The mansions
* - Your spouse, in fact, among those who come to mourn will be those eyeing to take over. (Funny but true)

The Question is...
*What have you prepared that will show or speak for you in Eternity or hereafter?*

This reality needs to be thought over: Therefore 
*Take care of these two things ..*
*1 - Your Salvation*
*2 - Sanctification (Holiness)*

Pass this message on to as many as you can because once your eyes close in death, the only property left with you is *Your Relationship WITH GOD.* 

Please pass this on as a means of Evangelism.
 *God bless You*

7/27/20, 10:15 PM - Progress tech: _GAIN DIRECTION..._

*Hold that thought!*

Someone wrote, “I am a mental tourist; my mind wanders!” Hahaha! That kinda describes me many times! No limits, no boundaries & sometimes all manner! We were told early in life to allow our imagination to run wild. They taught us that it’s a secret to releasing the creative genius inside. 

Well, they were partially right! I let my imagination run wild. It truly released the creative genius. The problem is that, the genius ran off too. Now, my imagination is in the forest looking for my genius! 

I will almost always agree that the ability to think freely & without blinders is good for a successful & balanced life! Anyone who cannot traffic along, track with & process through critical, conflicting & sometimes confusing thoughts, will always be subject to the manipulation of higher minds! And that’s a different kind of problem! A problem that calls for the Bob Marley challenge: “emancipate yourself from mental slavery”.

*You are responsible!*

But then, thinking freely & allowing every foul thought to pollute the mind are not the same. Random’ foolish or hurtful thoughts will always pop into the mind, but giving them a foothold or allowing them to run the mind is disastrous! No one may be blamed if a bird flying across, poops on his head, but we sure will consider the person complicit in his own ‘shamification’ if he does nothing as the bird perches on his head & begins to build a nest! It is our responsibility to make sure that wrong thinking does not become a stronghold in our lives! 

*Some thoughts are poison!*

- hateful, envious, bitter, resentful & vengeful thoughts! 

- lustful, permissive, obsessive & depraved sexual fantasies! 

- reproachful, self loathing, demeaning & inadequacy self talk! 

- pessimistic, despairing, depressing, ‘life sucks’ negativity! 

- victim, bondage, cursed, oppressed & negative destiny mindset! 

- restless, anxious, competitive, ‘others are ahead of me’ stress! 

*Strange thoughts can be arrested*

“We use our powerful God–tools for smashing warped philosophies, tearing down barriers erected against the truth of God, fitting every loose thought and emotion and impulse into the structure of life shaped by Christ.” - 2 Cor 10:5 (MSG). 

Some thoughts are enemy soldiers! They did not originate from your mind. They are like disease particulates floating in the mind space & looking for where to settle. If you give them a good ground, an infection may occur. Take authority & arrest them! The New King James Version rendering of 2 Cor 10:5, puts it this way; “bringing every thought into captivity”! Yes! Be present! Be attentive! Be conscious! Fight for your mental sanity! Rebuke the foul thoughts! Decide not to entertain rubbish! 

*Transformation happens by renewal*

“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” - Rom 12:2

Now, if the thought-life is already infected, the answer is mind renewal by a consistent meditation on the word of God! Yes, pick up scriptures that speak to the issue you are battling with, and fill your mind with them. If you do it consistently & persistently, a transformation of your mind system will occur! It doesn’t happen in one day! The already built up, negative mental stronghold in you may fight back & strong; but if you keep at it, you will surely have your mind back - pure, rich & destiny facilitating! 

*May God give us grace to master our minds! May the flow of grace within us never stop! The life force of God bring ourselves into a new place in destiny in Jesus Christ name! Go forward & grow great!*

Much Love

7/28/20, 10:48 AM - +234 806 949 4521: *IN FEAR, I RETURNED THE WEDDING GOWN.*
*(My encounter with the HOLY SPIRIT)*

I had the privilege of doing my wedding shopping in the U.S. courtesy of my adorable parents. I went to one of the most expensive shops in New York. I tried on, up to five beautiful wedding gowns before making my final choice.

I settled for a tube like gown that had a small jacket on it. In excitement, I returned to my Aunty's house clutching my wedding gown on my chest.

That night in my sleep, I had a dream. A man in a silk robe sat in front of me and began to chat me up.

The conversation went thus:
Stranger: Why did you choose that wedding gown?
Me: It was the one that fitted me best.
Stranger: Do you know that half of your breast was revealed when you wore it?
Me: But there is a jacket to cover the exposed part of my breast.
Stranger: When you get to the reception, will you not remove the jacket?
Me: Removing the jacket at the reception is the fun of the gown. 
Stranger: With your breast out for public consumption?
Me: But we would have left Church. 
Stranger: At the reception, will there not be unbelievers there who will blaspheme my name? Those who will say see what she is wearing, and she calls herself a Christian.
Me: People don't think like that anymore. More so it is this tube like gowns that are reigning now.
Stranger: You seem to be adamant on wearing the tube.. What if I ask you to return it and pick a decent one that covers the upper part of your body?
Me: But I like this one. I'm not sure I want to return it.
Stranger: You are my precious daughter and I know you would not like to hurt me just as I would not like to hurt you.
Me: Who are you, please?
Stranger: I am the Holy Spirit, and your body is my temple. Keep my temple holy and I will keep your marriage holy. I will also keep your body holy. If you insist on wearing it, can you cope with breast cancer?
Me: Breast cancer?

I woke up sweating. By mid-day, I returned the gown to pick one that would not expose my breast.

There in that shop, I met the daughter of a very popular King in Nigeria. We got talking and I saw that she did not even go to the section of tube styles. When I asked her why she did not try on the tube style, she said My father (the King) will never allow it. He says *'Royalty does not dress indecently. '*

I learnt an eternal lesson that day. First from the Holy Spirit and two, from an earthly royal princess.

ROYALTY DOES NOT DRESS INDECENTLY.

IF YOU KEEP DRESSING WITH YOUR BREAST EXPOSED, CAN YOU STAND A BREAST CANCER LATER IN LIFE?

Maranatha!

7/28/20, 7:40 PM - +234 706 481 3929: Sir, where is the comedy? That she also does Ministry or she studied in West Africa, or that the other front line doctors with her are members of Trump's Republic party?

Pls, let's stick with the issues she raised, and debate the authenticity of her curing over 350 Covid patients using the trio of *Hydrochloroquine/Chloroquine + Azythromycin + Zinc.*

Truth be said, Medical researches have proved this to be correct, but because she's also Christian Minister or she is not with the popular left wing, we should do away with this truth and fact because of the so called comedy?

I beg to disagree, I only fault her on the use of mask, which she said we don't need, I'm sure she knows we need it, she also wore it in one of her online services, but I believe that was an exaggeration, I mean who needs a nose mask when there is a treatment that can also serve as preventive measure?

Let's not be quick to jump on the bandwagon. We need to start telling the truth about the politics behind the so called pandemic or is it PLANDEMIC!

PEACE.

   Greetings to you all today and I wish to inform you that, the long awaited POST UTME AND DIRECT ENTRY FORM of the UNIQUE INSTITUTION; UNIVERSITY OF PORTHARCOURT is out and registration set to commence Monday, July 27, 2020 and scheduled to end Friday, August 28, 2020...

*THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW AS AN APPLICANT*👇

*CUT-OFF MARK.*
  The cut-off mark, is a bench mark an applicant is to meet before he/she is eligible for application. And the stipulated cut-off mark for uniport is 180. Having 180  only guarantees you to buy the form and sit for the exams but not to gain admission. 

*REGISTRATION FLEXIBILITY.*
    Please note. You can get your form anywhere you're, as long as you have access to a reputable cyber cafe or access to Internet. So, you don't necessarily need to be around school to process your application.
 
*BEWARE OF SCAMMERS.*
   Now that the awaited form is out, you will be in a rush to register and with that, you might fall into wrong hands who are only after your money and not your registration. So, be careful with whoever you're dealing with online regarding your registration.

*PRICE OF FORM/REGISTRATION.*
  Please note, the price of form is N2000 and including the service charge of the cyber cafe or the individual handling the registration shouldnt be more than N3500 and anyone taking more than N3500 for everything is just a thief.

That's all you need to know for now.

This number above just called me past 12pm today calling me a wrong name so I told him wrong number and dropped the call
Immediately I ended the call Truecaller showed his name as 'THIEF'
so when he called back I was ready, he now mentioned my name and said his calling from my bank...
So I told him to hold on as I hand over the phone to my lawyer... He just ended the call and hasn't called me back since then.
These fraudsters  need salvation quickly.
Be careful what you disclose when talking with self acclaimed bank customer care agents.
It's well.

Those who claim that the faces are 10 maintain their positions because they consider any other face as unrecognizable,  in other word, they are not as complete as the other 10.

Those who claim that the faces are 11 [the 11th being found between 5 and 6] believe that as long as the image is acknowledged as a face, whether it is complete or half becomes immaterial. 

Funny enough, someone claims to have fished out a twelfth face [though it looks like a caricature] between image 9 and 8.

From here, the floor is open for discussion on the way we see things.

Redemption Camp 3 by 3 Km Arena, Faith Tabernacle-Canaanland, MFM Prayer City, Deeper Life Conference Centre, Other Churches Resume Worship on August 14 as Ogun Governor Eases Lockdown

• Schools also to resume partially.

The Ogun State Government has directed that all religious centres shut down as a result of Coronavirus pandemic be opened for worship on August 14, in strict compliance to stipulated guidelines.

The State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun announced this while updating newsmen on the efforts of his administration to combat the pandemic in the state.

Abiodun also ordered pupils and students in terminal classes in both public and private schools to resume lectures on August 4 in preparation for their various examinations. This means that christian universities and secondary schools such as Covenant University, Redeemers University, Anchor University, Mountain Top University, Redeemers High School, Deeper Life High School, Faith Academy and Mountain Top Schools among many others can earnestly get back to work with their avalanche of employees.ChurchGist.

He, however, stated that with the exception of students in the exit classes “all students in our schools will enjoy automatic promotion to the next class.”

He also declared that weekend lockdown in the state would continue till August 14, when Ogun reopens worship centres.

“In the last few weeks, two important subjects have pervaded public discourse as it concerns Ogun State and COVID-19. They border on reopening of schools and the reopening of worship centres. These two subjects have peculiar importance to us as a Government.

“The education sector has not only been one of the biggest industries in our dear State, and there is no gainsaying that we are the education capital of Nigeria. We also are homes to the biggest worship centres ... in Nigeria:... and Christianity. Here is where people come from different parts of the nation and even from all over the world to worship God in truth and in Spirit.

We give praise and thanks to God for opening the doors of the churches and declare in faith that Lagos will be open in no time.

7/30/20, 10:29 AM - Dotman: Joseph, from what Jake Sule just typed you might need to drink the garri without meat
7/30/20, 10:31 AM - Solomon Lawal: But the Bible make us to understand that Jesus has paid for all of our sin via is blood, so eating can now be a thing of personal conviction.

7/30/20, 12:10 PM - Izu: Is the animal killed offered as a sacrifice?
Is it offered to idol?

If its offered as a sacrifice to an idol then this👇🏾
1 Corinthians  8:7 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.  
8:8 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.  
8:9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.  
8:10 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;  
8:11 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?  
8:12 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.  
8:13 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.

Note: it☝🏾 didn't condemn eating the meat but for the sake of the weak.


But if the meat isn't offered as a sacrifice, no condition stops you from enjoying yourself.

7/30/20, 2:04 PM - Nancy Wog: Amen
7/30/20, 2:10 PM - Izu: I didn't say so. If u read d scripture I gave carefully you'd know what I'm saying

7/30/20, 2:23 PM - Izu: It's not what goes into a man that defiles a man but what comes from a man for whatever enters into the stomach ends up in the toilet.

Mark  7:14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:  
7:15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.  
7:16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  
7:17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.  
7:18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;  
7:19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?  7:20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.  
7:21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,  
7:22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:  
7:23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

From the above scripture u know there's nothing wrong in eating what is sacrificed to idols..

1 Corinthians  10:25  Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:   1 Corinthians  10:27  If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.

For your sake, eating the meat isn't wrong at all.

But.
1 Corinthians  8:10  For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;   
1 Corinthians  10:28  But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:

But for the sake of the weaker one as clearly stated in the scripture, do not eat. Beyond our conviction and belief in the finished word, we must consider the faith for a weaker brother who hasn't coke of knowledge as u are.
7/30/20, 2:26 PM - Skillful joe: @2348053536340, you came from a Muslim background. Please tell us, do Muslims sacrifice sallah  meat to idols?
7/30/20, 2:26 PM - Izu: As for the salah meat, it wasn't offered to you as something sacrificed to idol but as a show of love and this is judging from what I've experienced and if it's so, eating the meat isn't a big deal at all. It's not bad.

I believe we understand.

I don't know where the idea of it is offered as sacrifice to idols came from. I don hear am no be today.

A Kentucky garbage man noticed no trash cans were being put out at an elderly woman's house on his route for two straight weeks. He was concerned enough to share the address with his supervisor. She found the name of the woman at the address and called her: “Ms. Smith, we noticed you haven't put out your cans for a while.  Are you ok?” Ms. Smith replied: “I’m ok. But my caretaker was so afraid of the virus that she stopped coming. I can’t get to the store. I don’t have any trash because I’ve run out of food. And I don’t have any family to help me.” After a long pause, the caller said: “You do now. We are your family.”

She let her truck driver know of the sad news.  The next day, on his day off, he knocked on her door and asked her to make up a grocery list. “Ms. Smith— the list is too short.” She added a few more items. “Ms. Smith, this list is still too short. Would you mind if I looked into your fridge?” She relented. He opened the fridge and it was bare. Empty.  

An hour later, he brought in dozens of bags of groceries for a woman he hardly knew.  

Tears. An air-hug that met social distancing protocol. And the garbage man walked out of the house of this woman who was physically immobile, but levitating. A garbage man decided he’d reach out to someone and church broke out. His supervisor shared the creed with this elderly woman: “You have a family now.”

Church is happening all around us. It’s a phone-call. It’s a bag of groceries. It happens anytime someone tells another person who is Jesus in his best disguise: “You have a family now.” Real church is not defined by a service of worship, but by servants of Christ.

*Keep being church.* That’s all you have to do.

7/31/20, 10:18 PM - +234 706 481 3929: *THE DEAD EVANGELIST IN CHOIR ROBE!*

Brother Clifford made it a duty upon himself that come sunshine and rain, he will be at the Train Station distributing Gospel Tracts to passengers as they board or leave the train! This he did faithfully for several years! 

One day at the church service after a rendition by the choir members in church, the choir was appreciated, praised and given a standing ovation! Brother Clifford, instead of being happy for them was very sad! He thought his soul winning efforts was not being acknowledged, rewarded or recognised by the church members and ministers! 

He also noticed that nobody from the station has met him to say thank you for what he has been faithfully doing over the years!

Brother Clifford decided to abandon the trips to the Train Station! Instead he joined the choir and started singing with them! To his surprise he was warmly welcomed! He discovered also that very soon he was singing and receiving standing ovations. He concluded in his mind he has just made the right decision!

One day, he sang Psalm 23 as a solo and by the time he finished singing, the whole church including the pastoral team and the elders were on their feet clapping and giving him a standing ovation! 

Suddenly there arose an old man, a stranger in the midst of the congregation who asked to sing the same song while the church was still on their feet clapping for the soloist! 
Against protocol, the pastor cynically allowed the old man to sing! 

By the time the old man finished singing, the whole church was on their knees, some weeping, others praying in repentance!
 
That day, there was no more sermon but an altar call! With sinners giving their lives and backsliders returning to their first love and the whole church rededicating its live!

Brother Clifford, the evangelist in choir robe, felt a deep hole in his heart! He felt empty! He saw the difference between entertainment for the appreciation of men and the ministration for the appreciation of heaven! He left the church with a heavy heart. 

Without thinking of removing his choir robe, he headed for the Train Station empty handed as if in a trance! Getting there he met a man in the same spot where he used to stand to distribute gospel leaflets before! The man was distributing gospel tracts and handed him one. The Tract read "I WILL BE A FAITHFUL SOLDIER, I WILL DIE AT MY POST". It ended asking, "are you a faithful witness of the WORD?"

With tears in his eyes and a shaky voice, he asked the man how he came  to start distributing the tracts at the spot in the Train Station! The busy man, not looking at him, told him of a dead man who used to come there come sunshine and rain to distribute tracts! That for months the man has not been there! He told him that he believed and concluded the man must be dead! He said the dead man once gave him a tract before that changed his commitment to CHRIST! And since the man was dead, he felt GOD wanted him to replace the dead man to continue the good work in the memory of the dead man! 

The man kept emphasising, "The Dead Man, The Dead Man" which further sent Brother Clifford back to his knee weeping and asking for GOD'S forgiveness!

Hmm...
If you are still reading this believe me, GOD has set you up to read it because He has a purpose for your life! 

Have you left your assignment because of some discouragements from cynics and critics? 

Have you abandoned the unheard, unseen and unsung praise of heaven for the standing ovation of men? 

Are you like the evangelist in choir robe? Or are you like the singer singing to entertain in church; the place of entertainment is in the theatre not the church! 

The church is for ministration in the Spirit by Worshiping GOD in The Spirit and The Truth! 

GOD ASKED ME TO TELL YOU TODAY THAT HE IS A GOD OF SECOND CHANCES RETURN TO YOUR FIRST LOVE TODAY!

"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28"

Devotion: Sometimes, as God's children, we go through tough situations. These tough situations work together to strengthen our faith. Whatever happens to you, dear reader, it will definitely work for your good. In the Bible, Job went through all the hardships you could think of but in the end they worked together for his good. It is only Christians that have this assurance that the good and bad things they suffer in life work together for their good. This is simply because it is God who is working behind the scenes to enhance the life of His loved ones.

All things are working out for your good this month in Jesus name amen.

8/3/20, 11:22 AM - Skillful joe: BREAKING: Shoprite to exit Nigeria
PublishedAugust 3, 2020

‌
Kayode Oyero


 
South African Company, Shoprite Holdings Limited, says it will auction off its outlets in Nigeria, The PUNCH has learnt.

This is coming about 15 years after it opened its first store in Lagos in December 2005.

The megastore company with presence in most Nigerian cities hinged this decision on the coronavirus pandemic which has disrupted major businesses globally.

In an “Operational and Voluntary Trading Update (52 Weeks Ended 28 June 2020)” released on Monday, the company said it has been approached by “various potential investors”.


The update partly read, “Despite difficult circumstances, in a year incorporating the COVID-19 lockdown and accompanying regulations governing trade, transport and operations, the Group increased total sale of merchandise for the 52 weeks to 28 June 2020 (including the impact of hyperinflation in the prior year) by 6.4% to approximately R156.9 billion. Like-for-like growth for

the year was 4.4%.

“Following approaches from various potential investors, and in line with our re-evaluation of the Group’s operating model in Nigeria, the Board has decided to initiate a formal process to consider the potential sale of all, or a majority stake, in Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited, a subsidiary of Shoprite International Limited.


“As such, Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited may be classified as a discontinued operation when Shoprite reports its results for the year. Any further updates will be provided to the market at the appropriate time.”

The company, which provides jobs for more than 2,000 Nigerians, has over 25 stores across eight states of the Federation including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
8/3/20, 12:33 PM - Alex Wog Drama: It's unfortunate the thousands of people that'll go out of job because of this.

Then those who won't be comfortable with it will go, while others may just have to tighting their belt and adjust with the new system. Example was the access bank take over of the intercontinental bank. One of us that used to be in this group worked with the latter and was asked to either take a pay cut or 🚶🏿‍♂️.

8/4/20, 11:26 AM - +234 806 450 5611: "MUMMY, CALM DOWN PLEASE"

When i was watching this video 2 days ago, i actually thought the boy was referring to his mum alone.

But, after some time, i got to realize that this boy is actually passing a message to you and I.

To those of us that have watched that video and you are condemning it for reasons best known to you. That is not my own area of concentration. My concern is on the message i got from the video.

That you are reading this now, you are the mummy in this article. "You must be calming down" to read this please (smiles).

Mummy, what is that challenge you are going through and you think it's over?..... please, calm down.

Is it your marriage that is giving you tough time and you think yours is the worst?.... Please, calm down

You are working like an elephant and you are eating like a rat. Your financial status is a threat to your life..... Just calm down please.

You've graduated for months/years and there is no comfortable job coming forth?... Don't be surprise if i still tell you to just calm down.

Pressure is all over you. Your friends are already getting married and you are still single. In fact, your younger ones are already carrying the title 'Mrs'....... Ma, just calm down.

You've being married for years and no issue at all. Or, miscarriage is the end product of every of your pregnancy..... Yes, Just calm down.

People are already mocking you and they are calling you all sorts of name because of your present situation. You are not the first person. Hannah and many others were mocked too......... Just calm down please.

You've being nursing a particular sickness or ailment for a very long time. Now you wish death is better than stress and pain. Do you know that, when you still have life, you have hope? ...... Sweetie, calm down please.

The list goes endless but whatever may be your own trouble(either stated or not). Jesus is still in that boat. He is not asleep. He can still calm the storm. So, you need to just calm down.

Mummy, calm down and rest like this🛌

No matter the amount of prayers you've rendered, just keep your faith alive. Don't fail your faith at the very minute you are about to get a solution.
Let your trust in God be awake. God has never retired from his duty.

If every human being are ask to drop our problems on a table and exchange it with others, i am very sure most of us will gently pick back his/her own problem and leave quietly. 

No perfect life any where so my dear, calm down and stop wearing sorrowful face all the time like the whole problem are on you alone. Nobody has it all.

People only tell and celebrate their success. When they want to celebrate their pain, they will tag it with "Admin, pls hide my ID" so you won't know they have pains too.

God knows about Abraham's childlessness. He knew about Job's predicament. Jesus knew about the storm on the sea even when He seems asleep.

Don't relent in tabling that situation before God timely. Hanna's story changed a particular day. That wasn't her first of praying or going to Shiloh.

That woman of 10years bareness in shackles part 1 by Mike Bamiloye, was  calm for much time but at the minute of God answering her prayers, she loosed her calmness, that was why she fell into the trap of that false prophetess. Thank God for grace.

Calm down and don't let your present situation to push you into everlasting regret. Your solution is at the corner.

However, your calming down is not a reason why you should exhibit nonchalant attitude in dealing with that situation.

Take goodly and godly steps while searching for a solution and don't let your steps be out of God's will.

That friend of mine once said "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light"

MUMMY, CALM DOWN PLEASE🙏. GOD STILL HAS YOU AT HEART. HE CAN NEVER FORGET HIS OWN. TO AVOID ENDING IN A DITCH, DO NOT RUN AHEAD OF GOD. CALM DOWN PLEASE

NB: Kindly give this widest circulation as the Lord give you grace without alteration. Thanks.....

Good MORNING
